This software allows you to send viewers to your Twitch live stream without the need for a proxy. The way it works is through Selenium, which enters proxy sites, types the channel name, and then reduces the stream quality to 160p. This allows you to connect to the live stream as a viewer through a proxy without having to pay for one..

- The working logic is simple. croxyproxy is a proxy website that connects to the website you want with proxies, and this code automates the process with Selenium.

‚ö†Ô∏è it is recommended to use this software on another computer (not the one you are streaming from) or on a computer with a large amount of RAM because it opens a lot of hidden tabs in the background and can send as many viewers as you want to the stream.

# Installation & Usage

- Python must be installed
- If your Python is not installed, download the latest version (3.11) of python and make sure to click on the 'ADD TO PATH' during installation.

- Chromedriver latest version should be already included, make sure you have latest Google Chrome version.
  
- Clone this repo or download manually, then run "INSTALL.bat"

## Usage

# CMD Mode or GUI Mode?

- CMD mode has two modes, Run once or Run in repeat. Running once it closes after sending viewers and the viewers may leave after some time. Repeat mode tries to keep the viewers stable by re-running it after every close.

- GUI MODE IS STILL IN BETA! in GUI mode, you just run the GUI mode bat and you fill your settings and either press Run Once and Run Repeat.

# Usage recommendations

- This system opens multiple background sites, so make sure you have plenty of RAM or perform this operation on an unused computer. (It could be on a powerful virtual server.)

- If the audience delivery takes too long and sends only a few viewers, close the client and reopen it, then repeat the same steps. (Proxy sites can sometimes slow down.)

- To stop the repeating, simply close the script.

- Gather some friends to viewbot you!

Go Wild.
